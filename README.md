**Potential use cases**

- Generating AI-assisted code while deliberately avoiding fingerprinting or tracking.  
  Examples include development activities related to darknet sites or any other contexts where strong anonymity and non-attribution are required.

The long-term goal is to help mitigate AI fingerprinting techniques across various use cases.

**Recommendation regarding dependencies**

I strongly advise against vendoring (bundling) any external packages into the project you aim to obfuscate. In practice, this approach tends to create significant maintenance and compatibility issues over time.
